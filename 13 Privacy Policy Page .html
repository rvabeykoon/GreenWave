			<font size="2">THE PERSONAL INFORMATION</font></P>
			<P align="justify">
			<font size="2">WE COLLECT<br>
			When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain 
			information about your device, including information about your web 
			browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are 
			installed on your device. When we talk about “Personal Information” 
			in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information 
			and Order Information. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we 
			collect information about the individual web pages that you view, 
			what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and 
			information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this 
			automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”<br>
			<br>
			We collect Device Information using the following technologies:<br>
			<br>
			- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or 
			computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. You can 
			find more information about cookies and how to disable them here.<br>
			<br>
			- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data 
			including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, 
			referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.<br>
			<br>
			- “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to 
			record information about how you browse the Site.<br>
			<br>
			HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
			<br>
			When you make a donation or purchase something from our store, as 
			part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal 
			information you give us such as your name, address, and email 
			address. We save this information in order to have a record of who 
			has made donations or purchases, to aggregate total donations per 
			person, and so that we can send out Tree Certificates and receipts 
			as needed. We will never trade, share, or sell your personal data 
			with anyone. Should we become aware of any kind of breach in our 
			data systems where your personal information may be compromised, we 
			will immediately notify you.<br>
			<br>
			When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your 
			computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us 
			with information that helps us learn about your browser and 
			operating system.<br>
			<br>
			We also use the Device Information mentioned above to help us screen 
			for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and 
			more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by 
			generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact 
			with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and 
			advertising campaigns).<br>
			<br>
			We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our donors 
			use the Site. You can read more about how Google uses your Personal 
			Information here. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here.<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, we may use your Personal Information to provide you 
			with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe 
			may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted 
			advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising 
			Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page here. You can opt out of some 
			of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s 
			opt-out portal here.<br>
			<br>
			EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS<br>
			<br>
			When you provide us with personal information to complete a donation 
			or transaction, sign up for our newsletter, sign up to become a 
			business partner or tree ambassador, or join our network of planting 
			partners, your information will be stored in our email platform so 
			that we can send you project updates, news, or other messages via 
			email. When you take certain actions, such as submitting your first 
			donation as a new business partner, you will be tagged in our system 
			to receive some automated communications based on those actions. 
			This helps ensure that you get only the most appropriate emails, and 
			that we can properly categorize individuals to receive content 
			relevant to you. Our emails are generally sparse and we take care 
			not to bombard you with too much information or marketing. You can 
			unsubscribe at any time at the bottom of any email, or simply 
			contact us at hello@onetreeplanted.org in order to be removed from 
			these lists.<br>
			<br>
			CONSENT<br>
			<br>
			When you provide us with personal information to make a donation or 
			complete a transaction, verify your credit card, or use a web form 
			to receive information, we imply that you consent to our collecting 
			it and using it for that specific reason. If you would like to 
			withdraw your consent or request that we delete your personal 
			information at any time, you may contact us at hello@onetreeplanted.org 
			to let us know.<br>
			<br>
			If you are a European resident, you have the right to access 
			personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal 
			information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to 
			exercise this right, please contact us.<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are 
			processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might 
			have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), 
			or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed 
			above. Additiona</font></P></td>
