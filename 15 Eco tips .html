			<p align="justify"><b>Planting a Tree</b><br>
			Planting a tree is a lifelong investment. How well this investment 
			grows depends on the type of tree selected and the planting 
			location, the care provided during planting, and the follow-up care 
			after planting. Getting your new tree off to a healthy start will 
			help the tree mature to its full size and ensures it will provide 
			environmental, economic, and social benefits throughout its 
			lifetime. <a href="New_TreePlanting.pdf">read more</a></p>
			<p align="justify"><b>When to Plant</b><br>
			Ideally, trees are planted during the dormant season – in the fall 
			after leaf drop or in early spring before budbreak. Weather 
			conditions are cool and allow plants to establish roots in the new 
			location before spring rains and summer heat stimulate new top 
			growth. Healthy balled and burlapped or container trees, however, 
			can be planted throughout the growing season if given appropriate 
			care. In tropical and subtropical climates where trees grow year 
			round, any time is a good time to plant a tree, provided that 
			sufficient water is available.</p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Planting Stress</b><br>
			Balled and burlapped trees lose a significant portion of their root 
			system when dug at the nursery. As a result, trees commonly exhibit 
			what is known as “transplant shock.” Transplant shock is a state of 
			slowed growth and reduced vitality following transplanting. 
			Container trees may also experience transplant shock, particularly 
			if they have circling or kinked roots that must be cut. Proper site 
			preparation, careful handling to prevent further root damage, and 
			good follow-up care reduces transplant shock and promotes faster 
			recovery.</p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Steps for Planting</b><br>
			Locate all underground utilities prior to digging.<br>
			Identify the trunk flare. The trunk flare is where the trunk expands 
			at the base of the tree. This point should be partially visible 
			after the tree has been planted.<br>
			Dig a shallow, broad planting hole. Holes should be 2-3 times wider 
			than the root ball, but only as deep as the root ball.<br>
			Remove the containers or cut away the wire basket. Inspect container 
			tree root balls for circling roots. Straighten, cut, or remove them.<br>
			Place the tree at the proper height. Take care to dig the hole to 
			the proper depth – and no more. If the tree is planted too deep, new 
			roots will have difficulty developing because of a lack of oxygen.<br>
			Straighten the tree in the hole. Before backfilling, have someone 
			view the tree from several directions to confirm it is straight.<br>
			Fill the hole gently, but firmly. Pack soil around the base of the 
			root ball to stabilize it. Fill the remainder of the hole, firmly 
			packing the soil to eliminate air pockets that may dry out roots. 
			Further reduce air pockets by watering periodically while 
			backfilling. Avoid fertilization at the time of planting.<br>
			Stake the tree, if necessary. Studies have shown that trees 
			establish more quickly and develop stronger trunk and root systems 
			if they are not staked at the time of planting.<br>
			Mulch the base of the tree. Mulch is organic matter spread around 
			the base of a tree to hold moisture, moderate soil temperature 
			extremes, and reduce grass and weed competition.
			<a href="ProperMulching.pdf">read more</a><br>
			Provide follow-up care. Keep the soil moist, but not water-logged. 
			Water trees at least once a week, barring rain, and more frequently 
			during hot, windy weather</p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Avoiding Tree and Utility Conflicts</b><br>
			Determining where to plant a tree is a decision that should not be 
			taken lightly. Many factors should be considered prior to planting. 
			When planning what type of tree to plant, remember to look up and 
			look down to determine where the tree will be located in relation to 
			overhead and underground utility lines.
			<a href="Avoiding_Conflicts.pdf">read more</a>&nbsp; </p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Overhead Lines</b><br>
			Overhead utility lines are easy to spot, yet often overlooked. 
			Planting tall-growing trees under or near these lines eventually 
			requires your utility provider to prune them to maintain safe 
			clearance from the wires. This pruning may result in the tree having 
			an unnatural appearance. Periodic pruning can also lead to a 
			shortened life span for the tree.<br>
			<br>
			Tall-growing trees near overhead lines can cause service 
			interruptions when trees contact wires. Children or adults climbing 
			in these trees can be severely injured or even killed if they come 
			in contact with the wires. Proper selection and placement of trees 
			in and around overhead utilities can eliminate potential public 
			safety hazards, reduce expenses for utilities and their customers, 
			and improve landscape appearance.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Underground Lines</b><br>
			Trees consist of much more than what you see above ground. Many 
			times, the root area below ground is larger than the branch spread. 
			Many of the utility services provided today run below ground. Tree 
			roots and underground lines often coexist without problems. However, 
			trees planted near underground lines could have their roots damaged 
			if the lines are dug up for repair.<br>
			<br>
			The greatest danger to underground lines occurs during planting. 
			Before you plant, make sure that you are aware of the location of 
			any underground utilities. To be certain that you do not 
			accidentally dig into any lines and risk serious injury or a costly 
			service interruption, call your utility company or utility locator 
			service first. Never assume that these utility lines are buried 
			deeper than you plan to dig.</p>
